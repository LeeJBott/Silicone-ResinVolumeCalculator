# Mould Volume & Silicone/Resin Mixture Calculator...  
Find estimated volume of rectangular/cubic moulds when pouring silicone/resin.  
Then the program will work out how much silicone/resin + catalyst/activator to efficiently fill mould with minimal waste.  

## Use to figure out the correct overall mix of silicone when making moulds.  
Don't forget this program does not measure displacement from the master model when placed inside silicone.   
So if you mix it to the exact amount the program tells you, you will likely have a little too much.  

My mix is 100 parts raw silicone to 5 parts catalyst: change this to tailor your needs per product as most will have differing methods/measurements.  
Rough guide only.  
Saves working it out.
